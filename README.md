# Etch A Sketch App

## What is Etch A Sketch?

```bash
Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes of France 
and subsequently manufactured by the Ohio Art Company. It is now owned by Spin Master 
of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. 
There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. 
Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, 
leaving a solid line. The knobs create lineographic images. The left control 
moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically.
